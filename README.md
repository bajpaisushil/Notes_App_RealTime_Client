# Notes App RealTime Client

A realtime notes application client built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This minimal project demonstrates hot module replacement (HMR) and comes with an extensible ESLint configuration for improved code quality.

## Overview

This project is designed to help you quickly set up a modern React application using TypeScript and Vite. It includes:
- **Fast Refresh** support via either `@vitejs/plugin-react` or `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`
- A basic ESLint setup that can be expanded for type-aware linting and additional stylistic rules
- A simple structure to serve as the starting point for a realtime notes application

## Features

- **Modern Frontend Stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite for fast development and efficient builds
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Instant feedback during development
- **Configurable Linting:** ESLint is set up with the option to enable type-checked and stricter rules for production

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 14 or higher
- A package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/bajpaisushil/Notes_App_RealTime_Client.git

text

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

cd Notes_App_RealTime_Client

text

3. **Install Dependencies**

npm install

text
or if you prefer Yarn:
yarn install

text

### Running the Application

Start the development server with hot module replacement enabled:

npm run dev

text

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the URL displayed in your terminal).[1]

### Building for Production

Create an optimized production build by running:

npm run build

To preview the production build locally, use:

npm run preview

## ESLint Configuration

For a production-ready setup, consider enhancing your ESLint configuration to include type-aware linting. In your `eslint.config.js`, you can expand the configuration as follows:

export default tseslint.config({
extends: [
// Replace with type-checked rules for production:
...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
// Optionally, for stricter rules:
// ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
// And for stylistic rules:
// ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
],
languageOptions: {
parserOptions: {
project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
},
},
});

text

You can also add React-specific linting by installing the following plugins:

npm install eslint-plugin-react-x eslint-plugin-react-dom --save-dev

text

Then update your ESLint config to include them:

import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x';
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom';

export default tseslint.config({
plugins: {
'react-x': reactX,
'react-dom': reactDom,
},
rules: {
...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
},
});
